**Spam Email Classifier – Project Overview**

**📝 About the Project**

This project involves building a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their textual content. The purpose is to demonstrate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms in the real-world problem of email or SMS filtering.

The project is a part of my internship module focused on applying AI and ML techniques to practical use cases.

**🎯 Project Goals**

Understand how text data can be converted into a machine-readable format.

Apply machine learning techniques for text classification.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Show how AI can reduce manual work by automatically detecting unwanted messages.

**📂 Dataset Information**

The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, a widely recognized benchmark dataset for spam detection.

It contains over 5,000 SMS messages labeled as either ham (legitimate) or spam.

Each message contains natural text in English, making it suitable for NLP tasks.

**🔍 What I Did in This Project**

Explored and cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and mapping text labels to numerical values.

Preprocessed the data by transforming text into numerical features using a technique called vectorization.

Split the data into training and test sets to validate the performance of the model.

Trained a machine learning model (Naive Bayes) to learn patterns from labeled messages.

Tested and evaluated the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to understand how well it performs.

Documented the entire process clearly and structured the code to be easy to understand and reuse.

**📚 Skills Demonstrated**

Text preprocessing and NLP fundamentals

**🔗 Relevance to AI & Industry**

Spam detection is a core AI application used in email clients, messaging platforms, and cybersecurity tools. This project shows how AI can:

Improve user experience by filtering unwanted content

Reduce time wasted on manual filtering

Identify patterns that are not easy to detect with traditional rules
